            <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Media Arts and Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where my research focuses on spintronics and sustainable computing. I hold a Master of Science (S.M.) from MIT, where I studied van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials for spintronic applications. Prior to this, I earned a dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, where my thesis focused on the interaction of Surface Acoustic Waves and Magnetization.</p>
            <p>My current research involves developing nanoscale devices using 2D magnetic materials and designing brain-inspired stochastic computing hardware, to achieve scalable and energy-efficient computing technologies. My graduate work has tackled some fundamental issues in translating vdW magnets into spintronic technologies, by creating the first device for field-free electrical control of vdW magnets above room temperature. My work was recognized with the MIT-HPI Design for Sustainability Grant in 2023. I have also delivered a talk at TEDxBostonâ€™s Planetary Stewardship forum on sustainable computation. My ongoing work is driven by a commitment to advancing sustainable and energy-efficient computing technologies.</p>
            <p>An engineer at heart, I find joy in building things and have designed and built several setups for fabrication and measurements during my time at MIT, gaining valuable experience in instrumentation and automation. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, particularly hiking in the mountains, camping, and relaxing at the beach. I am also trained in playing the harmonium and love playing snooker.</p>
            <p>My professional experience includes a role as a Digital Hardware Design Engineer at Intel Corporation, where I worked on the design and verification of DFX logic for graphics cores in the Alder Lake SoC. As a Research Intern at Purdue University, I developed a theoretical model for NV-centre qubits and built a simulation suite for studying ferromagnetic nanoscale microwave sources. Additionally, I interned at Superbolter in Bangalore, where I designed and built a Python-based computer vision toolkit for a virtual reality interior designing platform, adding breadth to my technical experience.</p>
